# Configuration conventions: Base Registry Engine

## BReg authored formats

This section covers the formats an adopter and an operator write for the
Base Registry Engine: `registry.yaml`, `module.yaml`, `runtime.yaml`, and the
package a `bregctl package` run seals around them.

### BREAKING: the shared reader reads `registry.yaml` and `module.yaml`

`bregctl`, the package builder, and `breg` read a project and its modules
through the shared Registry Stack reader. A file that was already outside the
documented grammar is now refused, and every refusal carries a code, a JSON
Pointer path, a line, a column, and the edit that fixes it.

| A file that writes | is refused as | Migrate by |
|---|---|---|
| `null`, `~`, or a key with no value | `config.null-value` | Deleting the key; an optional member is written by leaving it out. |
| an unquoted number where text is expected, such as `version: 1` or `version: 1.5` under `registry`, in a module, or in a module lock | `config.expected-string` | Quoting the value: `version: "1"`. A dotted version such as `0.1.0` is already text. |
| an unquoted value that looks like a number but is not a plain decimal: a leading zero (`0123`), a bare point (`.5`, `5.`), a base prefix (`0x1F`, `0o17`, `0b101`), `.inf`, or `.nan` | `yaml.ambiguous-number` | Quoting the value when it is text, or writing the plain decimal when it is a number. |
| a YAML anchor (`&name`), alias (`*name`), merge key (`<<`), or tag (`!tag`) | `yaml.anchor`, `yaml.alias`, `yaml.merge-key`, `yaml.tag` | Writing the shared value out in full at every place that used the alias. |
| `${NAME}`, `${NAME:-default}`, or `${NAME:?message}` in a value | `config.substitution-not-allowed` (was `source.environment_expression`) | Writing the literal value; a project and a module are reviewed artifacts, and only `runtime.yaml` takes environment values. |

A duplicate key, an unknown key, and a value of the wrong kind were already
refused; they are now reported with the reader's codes (`yaml.duplicate-key`,
`config.unknown-key`, `config.missing-key`, `config.invalid-type`) instead of
`source.yaml.invalid`, every unknown key in a file is reported rather than the
first, and an unknown key names the closest accepted key when one is near.
A tool that matched `source.yaml.invalid` or `source.environment_expression`
in `bregctl --format json` output must match the reader codes instead.

A package rederives its project from the `source/registry.yaml` and module
files it seals, at `bregctl package` and every time `breg` or `bregctl` loads
it. A package whose sealed sources carry one of the shapes above no longer
loads. Correct the source project, rebuild the package with `bregctl package
--baseline-package <deployed package>`, and apply it before starting the
upgraded runtime.
